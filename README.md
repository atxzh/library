## Learnt over the process

### HTML

- [x] Always rely on UTF-8
- [x] Depend on `.ico` for Favicon Icons

### CSS

#### Relevant to Creating Shapes

- [x] Create Progress Circle with SVG
    - Using Stroke
        - Stroke Width
        - Stroke Array

- [x] Create Shapes with CSS, if available, only then try SVG

- [x] `clip-path` works, `clip` is not standard
    - Also `clip-path` isn't responsive for content within
    - Needs a definitive SVG, doesn't work evenly on different sized content

#### Alignment

- [x] Always use `display` to give space to inline items
    - Works best with `display:flex`

- [x] Use Pixels for fixed alignment

- [x] `::before` and `::after` needs an explicit width or height, if previous element doesn't have height or width (esp. on `input` elements)
    - Input Elements can have pseudo-elements if `appearance: none`
